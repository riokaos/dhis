3.An overview of the development process, including key challenges
Development process:
-we use trello to organize our work in a kanban type methodology
-we first started with a prototype to visualize what we should be doing, then discussed it.
-client-server microarchitecture:
-we had 2 meetings a week, where we looked at the current process, everybody showing their code,
where we gave and received feedback. The proceeded to merge the branches, and solve any issues.
one of the meetings was on fridays, so that we could talk with the group leader about issues we where
having difficulties to understand, and it provided us with a kind of Customer feedback each week
-at the end of each meeting we created a document of what was still missing, and divided it upon the
members. Then we would fix a time and date for our next meeting, where we would go through the tasks
-if anyone had any problems we would discuss them via Hangouts

Key challenges:

-API: we took some time figuring out how to get the stocks dynamically for the usage and availability
-in the last part of the project we did some refactoring
-issues with planned graphical interface due to challenges
-issues with the dashboard


Improvements:
-fix return problem
-tab menu on top instead of Dropdown
-admin could have listed or searchable the existing stock profiles
