API DHIS2
About indicators and Dataelements:
What is referred to as a Data Element above, the key dimension that describes what is being
collected, is sometimes referred to as an indicator in other settings. In DHIS2 we distinguish
between Data Elements which describe the the raw data, e.g. the counts being collected, and
Indicators, which are formula-based and describe calculated values, e.g. coverage or incidence
rates that are used for data analysis.

Our project is based on the premise of a simple clean way for someone to obtain fast stats on commodities and stocks for one or more Organizational units.

We therefore have a  searchable dropdown  to choose one or many org units.

Project API calls:
Query for Orgunits:


Queries joining the stocks:
For the stocks we find that some are listed under indicators and some under dataelements.
Although the definition says that indicators are calculated, we will look into the difference and probably use one drop down included the commodities and stocks associated.
This could be aventually be set to be set via de admin.
The normal user will have a preset set of stocks but with advanced options he can choose whatever he wants.(just one value to do the analytics by)


The datastore:
the keys in our datastore are going to be the same names of the stocks, so taht we can list them in one combo, that relates to the usageID, availableID
JSON :
name = {name, usageID, availableID, min, max, fromMonth, toMonth, fromYear, toYear}
